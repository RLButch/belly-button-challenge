Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Analysis/Dashboard:
Dropdown menu to select an individual sample
Horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs for the selected individual
Bubble chart displaying all samples for the selected individual
Display of the selected individual's demographic information
Automatically updates all visualizations when a new sample is selected
(Optional) Gauge chart displaying the weekly washing frequency of the selected individual
